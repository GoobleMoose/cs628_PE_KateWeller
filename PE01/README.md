Assignment: Write a 150-word analysis report to explain how the program works in README.md in terms
of the input-process-output model. The README.md has three level-1 headings - Input, Process, and 
Output.

README.md uses markdown or HTML in order to format the output.
The input-process-output model, also known as IPO is essentially like a math function. There is some input that is then processed to produced an output that is different than the input.  The example given is a program that converts temperature in Fahrenheit to the temperature in Celsius.  The model is applicable to README.md because the input is in a different format than the output.  The input is in either markdown or HTML, the output is a formatted version.
